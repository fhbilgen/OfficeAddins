# OfficeAddins
In OfficeAddins repository there are only Microsoft Office Addin projects.
The first project is called MeetingCreator.

# MeetingCreator
It is an Outlook addin based on VSTO. Its purpose is to allow users to create meetings on irregular dates.
In Outlook it is possible to create a recurring meeting however, there is no User Interface where a meeting 
with the same participants and with the same subject can be created repeating on irregular dates.
e.g. meeting on the 6th, 19th May and 30th of June. MeetingCreator tries to solve this.
