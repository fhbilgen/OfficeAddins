# OfficeAddins
In OfficeAddins repository there are only Microsoft Office Addin projects.
The first project is called MeetingCreator.

# MeetingCreator
It is an Outlook addin based on VSTO. Its purpose is to allow users to create meetings on irregular dates.
In Outlook it is possible to create a recurring meeting however, there is no User Interface where a meeting 
with the same participants and with the same subject is repeated on irregular dates.
MeetingCreator tries to solve this.
